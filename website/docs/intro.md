# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**From Simulated Brains to Walking Bodies**

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on building intelligent humanoid robots using modern AI, simulation, and robotics technologies.

## What You'll Learn

This book takes you on a journey from foundational concepts to advanced humanoid robotics:

- **Part 1: Foundations** - Set up your development environment with ROS 2, URDF, and robot modeling
- **Part 2: Digital Twins & Simulation** - Master Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for realistic robot simulation
- **Part 3: Perception & Edge AI** - Implement computer vision with Intel RealSense, YOLO, and NVIDIA Jetson
- **Part 4: Vision-Language-Action Models** - Build multimodal AI systems that understand and act on natural language
- **Part 5: Advanced Topics** - Implement bipedal locomotion, whole-body control, safety systems, and production deployment

## Hardware Requirements

This book supports three hardware tiers:

### Budget Tier (~$500)
- CPU-only laptop (16GB RAM)
- Intel RealSense D435
- Basic simulation workflows

### Mid-Tier (~$2,500)
- NVIDIA RTX 3060/4060 desktop
- Intel RealSense D435
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
- Full Isaac Sim + edge deployment

### Premium Tier (~$8,000)
- NVIDIA RTX 4080/4090 workstation
- Intel RealSense D455
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX
- Multi-robot simulation + VLA training

## Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Python (intermediate), C++ (basic)
- **Math**: Linear algebra, basic calculus
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Windows with WSL2
